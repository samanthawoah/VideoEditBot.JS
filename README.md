A Discord.JS implementation of [VideoEditBot (Originally in Python)](https://github.com/GanerCodes/videoEditBot).
# How to host?
Right now, this barely works. I've just started working, however, rename `config.example.json` to `config.json`. Inside your new `config.json`, replace ` bot token goes here` with your bot token, and `bot id goes here` with your bot's id (Turn on developer mode, right click on your bot's name, "Copy ID").
